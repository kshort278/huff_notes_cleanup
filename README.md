##Huff Notes##

This repository contains a Python script that I wrote to clean up data about program notes from NYU's William K. Everson Collection, found here: http://www.nyu.edu/projects/wke/byseries/huff50s.php. It also contains two data files - one source file and the target_file output of the program.
